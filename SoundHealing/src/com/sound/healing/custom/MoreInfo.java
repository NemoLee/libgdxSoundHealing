					" centres (chakras) which should be open to allow free flow of energy. " +
					"Often we 'close down' to protect ourselves and create a block and sometimes " +
					"the energy centres are too open so we need to remember to visualise closing" +

					" sound, in a sequence creating a rainbow of colours from root to crown, and each" +

					"on top of the head) via all the other chakras en route. Before you begin" +
					" a reading for yourself or others, warm your voice up by focusing on " +
					"the breath. Relax the tongue, allow it lie flat on the floor of the" +
					" mouth, inhale through the tip of the nose, imagine your throat is " +
